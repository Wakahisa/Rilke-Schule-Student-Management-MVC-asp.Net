A field trip permission slip application

Web application project created during Software Engineering for a Client. 

Technologies: ASP.NET MVC, C#, HTML, CSS, SQL Server, 

August 2016 - December 2016

Problem: Students have the responsibility of delivering field trip slips to their guardians and then back to their teachers.
         Some students might lose their field trip slips to or from and are unable to attend the field trip.
         In addition, one of the secretaries has to enter all the data for the permission slip forms into excel and 
         that could take hours to complete.
         
Solution: Our application acts as the middleman and eliminates responsibility from the student. Teachers are able to create field trip forms
          and deliver them to guardians. The signatures obtained by the guardians are stored into a database, eliminating the need for the
          secretary to store them in digital form.
